## üîß **CORRECTIONS MADE**

### Fixed Critical Errors

#### 1. PHARMAC Subsidy Statement
**Before:** "PHARMAC subsidy means patients currently bear full treatment costs"  
**After:** "Absence of PHARMAC subsidy means patients currently bear full treatment costs"  
**Issue:** Wording implied subsidy existed when it doesn't

#### 2. Pharmacy Pricing Assumptions
**Before:** 
- Major chains: "Typically at the higher end of this range"
- Independent pharmacies: "May offer more competitive pricing"

**After:**
- Major chains: "Often offer competitive pricing (e.g., Chemist Warehouse: $459)"
- Independent pharmacies: "May charge higher rates ($540-565)"

**Issue:** Reality is opposite - major chains offer better pricing

#### 3. Regional Pricing Patterns
**Before:** Suggested independent pharmacies might offer better deals  
**After:** Clarified major chains provide competitive pricing, online ordering extends this nationwide  
**Issue:** Reflected actual market dynamics

2. **Contrave/Duromine pricing** - Current NZ market research required
